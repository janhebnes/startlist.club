Startlist.club is an open source project created for handling flightclub startlists and logbooks for pilots and plane.
Flight journaling is a repetitive task that needs to be as smooth as possible, many clubs have there own version of these journaling systems more or less integrated in existing flows. This is an attempt to gather the ressources into one system. 

Primary focus for this project is to satisfy the needs of soaring flightclubs in the northern european countries.  
You can login using facebook, google or mobile (SMS), flight editing is possible by all club members during 48 hours and changes are visible and logged. You can read more about the project at https://startlist.club/about
